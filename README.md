The notebook is based on the data analysis Geo-spatial Data. 
The notebook is based on the data analysis Geo-spatial Data. CDS API is used to download the dateset. 
Basic statistics were calculated and inferences were drawn from them. 
A neural network to predict the [Total Precipitation] from the two input variables [Temperature of air at 2m above the surface, Volumetric soil water layer 1]. The Deep Learning framework of choice is PyTorch .
Also some difficulties that I have faced due to the big dataset and limited memory availability.
